Here is an example of a Python program that uses nested IF statements on the left. 

In this program, the user enters two numbers. If number 1 is greater than number2, the program will move on to check the next IF statement indented by one level. If number2 is larger or the value of the two numbers is equal, this program does nothing. If number 1 is greater than number2 and number 2 is greater than 5, some text will be printed on the screen.

Nested statements are quite tricky to get the hang of and can be programmed using IF statements with AND conditions all in the same statement however, lines of code can become long and difficult to read. Nesting code keeps it very neat and tidy. It also makes it easier to see how the program functions.
