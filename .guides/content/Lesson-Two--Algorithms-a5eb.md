### What is an Algorithm?

An **algorithm** is a step-by-step sequence of instructions for carrying out some task.
- 	the central concept underlying all computation is that of the algorithm
-	programming can be viewed as the process of designing and implementing algorithms that a computer can carry out

A programmerâ€™s job is to:
-	create an algorithm for accomplishing a given objective, then
-	translate the individual steps of the algorithm into a programming language that the computer can understand
