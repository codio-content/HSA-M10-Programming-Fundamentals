**Selection** is a decision or question.

At some point in a program there may need to be a question because the program has reached a step where one or more options are available. Depending on the answer given, the program will follow certain steps and ignore others.

For example, in our sandwich-making program, our user could be given the choice between crunchy or creamy peanut butter.
