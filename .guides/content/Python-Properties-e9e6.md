### Python is…

1.	Strongly typed. It enforces data types so you can’t concatenate a string and a integer, for example.
2.	Dynamically, implicitly typed. So, you don’t have to explicitly declare variable data types. Data types are enforced at runtime.
3.	Case sensitive. For example, token and TOKEN are two different variables.
4.	Object-oriented. Everything is an object.



Python programs are written to solve real world problems. The process of breaking down a problem into a sequence of steps is known as an algorithm.
