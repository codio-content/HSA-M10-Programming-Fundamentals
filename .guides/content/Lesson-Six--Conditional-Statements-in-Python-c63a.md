## Why is selection important? 
Without selection, different paths would not be included in algorithms. This means that the solutions created would not be realistic.

Recall: Programs consist of a set of instructions that are carried out (performed) one after another.

Sometimes there may be more than one path (or set of steps) that can be followed. At this point, a decision needs to be made. This point is known as **selection**.

### Example Algorithm: Printing Grades

For example, a simple algorithm can be created to determine passing semester grades. The steps could be:

1. Ask what your grade percentage is
2. If you're grade is greater than 60, you have a passing grade
3. Otherwise you have a failing grade

The decision comes in step 2. If you're grade is higher than 60%, then you passed the course. Otherwise, you have a failed the course 

`IF…THEN…ELSE`

Selection allows several paths to be included in a program. In programming, selection is usually represented by the instructions IF, THEN and ELSE.

`IF` represents the question
`THEN` points to what to do if the answer to the question is true
`ELSE` points to what to do if the answer to the question is false

Using this method, the grades program now reads like this:
1. Ask what your grade is
2. `IF` grade is greater than 60, `THEN` passed course
3. `ELSE` failed course

If you try this algorithm using 80 as your grade, the answer to the question at step 2 is true, so the algorithm tells you that you have a passing grade.

If you try the algorithm using 50 as your grade, the answer to the question at step 2 is false, so the algorithm tells you that you have a failing grade.

Two different paths are followed according to the answer given to a particular question.
