Our current sandwich making algorithm seems very simple.  But is it really so simple? Where’s the bread? How do you “spread”? How do you put the two pieces of bread together?

You and I know how to do these things, but try telling a computer how to make a sandwich! When you write an algorithm for a computer, you have to be very specific, and you have to speak the computer’s language. 

If we introduce a few choices in our decision-making process, the algorithm can become even more complex. 
Review the changes to our flode chart on the left. Notice how the steps are much clearer, especially as we have introduced some choices in decision making which mean that the sequence of steps is no longer a straight line. We’ll talk about this on the next page.


1.	Get two pieces of bread
2.	Do you have the ingredients needed to make the sandwich? No = go to the store; Yes = next step
3.	Put peanut butter on one piece of bread
4.	Put jelly on the other piece of bread
5.	Put the two pieces together
6.	Are you allergic to peanut butter? Yes = don’t eat it! ; No = next step
7.	Eat your sandwich, which is now ready!

In our flow chart, we can see how decisions are handled.To the left, you can see 2 decisions being taken.
## Do you have the ingredients needed? 
The first decision asks the question "Do you have the ingredients needed to make the sandwich?"  At this point a decision has to be made. 
- If you do not have the ingredients needed, then you need to go to the store to get the required ingredients. 
- Otherwise, if you do have the ingredients, then you move onto the the next step, Put peanut butter on one piece of bread. 
## Are you allergic to peanut butter? 
The next decision follows the same principles. In this case however, if you are allergic, you should not eat the sandwich. If you are not, then you can continue to the next step of eating the prepared sandwich. Tasty!

When you are coding, you will come across decision situations all the time. A flow-chart helps you visualize this really nicely.
Writing your algorithm down is really important. Bad programmers often try to write code before they have done this and as a result write messy or badly thought out code.
