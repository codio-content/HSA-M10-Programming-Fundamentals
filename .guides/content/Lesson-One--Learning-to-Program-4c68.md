### What is a Program?

This lesson introduces you to the basic concepts of what a program is and how programs are used to solve real world problems. So, what is a program? 

||| info
A ***program*** is simply a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation.

The computation might be something mathematical, such as solving a system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a symbolic computation, such as searching and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough) compiling a program.

More technically, a program is a sequence of instructions for the computer (more specifically, for the CPU) to carry out in order to complete some task.

The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language:

#### ++Input++
- Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.
#### ++Output++
- Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.
#### ++Math++
- Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication.
#### ++Conditional Execution++
- Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of statements.
#### ++Repetition++
- Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.


Believe it or not, that’s pretty much all there is to it. Every program you’ve ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of instructions that look more or less like these. Thus, we can describe programming as the process of breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with sequences of these basic instructions.

#### Sequence: Program execution
Programs are simply a collection of statements. These statements are **executed** or processed, one after the other in the order written by the programmer. By default each and every program is executed sequentially.

That may be a little vague, but we will explain more as we talk about algorithms in the next lesson.  First though, let's take a closer look at the programming language that we will be using in this course, Python.
