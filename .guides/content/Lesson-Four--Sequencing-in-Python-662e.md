## Why is sequencing important?
It is crucial that the steps in an program are performed in the right order - otherwise the program will not run correctly and produce the expected output. 

Let's think back to our toothbrushing algorithm.  Suppose the steps for the tooth-brushing program were in this sequence:

**1. Use toothbrush to clean teeth**

**2. Put toothpaste on toothbrush**

**3. Rinse toothbrush**


A toothbrush would still be used to clean the teeth and toothpaste would still be put on the brush. But because steps 1 and 2 are in the wrong sequence the teeth wouldn’t get cleaned with the toothpaste, and the toothpaste would be wasted.

A human would realize they had forgotten to add toothpaste at the start of the process, but a computer would not know that anything was wrong.

   A computer can only do what it is programmed to do. 
   If the steps are programmed in the wrong sequence, 
   the computer will perform the tasks in this sequence 
   – even if this is incorrect.
