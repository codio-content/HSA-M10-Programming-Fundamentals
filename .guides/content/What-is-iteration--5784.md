**Iteration** in programming means repeating steps, or instructions, over and over again. This is often called a **loop**.

When a program needs to repeat certain steps until told to stop or a certain **condition** has been met, that is called **repetition**.  Consider the example below of the Splat Rat Game. (This game is similar to the popular Whack-A-Mole game.) 
In the Splat Rat Game the same steps, or instructions, are repeated for a certain amount of time. The timer starts at zero and the game ends after sixty seconds. The repetition, or loop, is this:
1. Pop up a new rat
2. Hit the rat
3. Increase score 

These steps are repeated until the condition is met (the timer ends).
