On the left you can see some Python code for our improved sandwich-making algorithm.
It’s not that scary is it?
Don’t worry about the details for now, but if you follow it through, you’ll see that it is all very logical.

There are three basic building blocks (constructs) to use when designing algorithms:
- sequencing
- selection
- iteration
