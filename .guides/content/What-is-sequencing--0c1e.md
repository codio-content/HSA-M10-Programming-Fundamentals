When designing algorithms, it is important to make sure that all the steps are presented in the correct order. This is known as **sequencing**, and can be displayed as a flowchart in flode.

Programs consist of instructions that are carried out (performed) one after another.   Sequencing is the specific order in which instructions are performed in an algorithm.

  
For example, a very simple algorithm for brushing teeth might consist of these steps:
- put toothpaste on toothbrush
- use toothbrush to clean teeth
- rinse toothbrush

Each step is an instruction to be performed. Sequencing is the order in which the steps are carried out.
